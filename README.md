# Arexvy
Hello! I am **Arexvy**. I work on web applications and games with Godot. I am a full-stack web developer who enjoys creating projects that appear simple and minimal to the viewer, often using flat dark colors. I hail from Sahiwal, Punjab, Pakistan, and I am currently 16 years old as of 2024. In the future, I aspire to be both a full-stack developer and a data scientist.

## My Projects

### Cubern
[Cubern](https://cubern.sbs) is an online sandbox where creativity knows no bounds. Here, you can develop games and customize your character to showcase your style and passion.
#### Behind the Scenes
For the workshop, I utilize Godot 4.2 (.NET) with custom compiled export templates for resource protection. It predominantly (99%) employs C# with minimal GDScript. I have also integrated [AOT Compilation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/) featured in .NET 8.0.
For the runtime programming language (clua), I use [Moonsharp](https://www.moonsharp.org/) both on the client and the game server.

On the website's backend, I leverage ExpressJS as I explore JavaScript. For the frontend, I opt for VueJS due to its user-friendly nature and Single Page Application feature, ensuring a smooth experience for users.

### D8 Programming Language
D8 is a high-level interpreted language currently under development in Python, as I am relatively new to the concept of programming languages. I aim to transition it to C++ or C# once I gain familiarity with interpreted languages. Although it is currently in its nascent stage, my goal is to develop it into a functional product for future use.
